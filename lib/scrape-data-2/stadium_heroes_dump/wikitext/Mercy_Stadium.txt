{{PatchTableStart}}<onlyinclude>
{{PatchTableElement|2025-08-26|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Mercy has consistently been one of the top heroes in Stadium and hasn't yet received any major updates. In this update we have a large suite of changes with the goal of adding more variety to how Mercy players can build. Most notably Crepusuclar Circle has been replaced. It has long been a dominant pick that made it very difficult to build any other way as well as being a pain point for Mercy's opponents. However, we've added two new powers in its place. So, we hope you'll enjoy exploring the new options. We've tried to make Ability Power builds and Caduceus Blaster builds more realistic with new Power interactions and updated itemization.}}
