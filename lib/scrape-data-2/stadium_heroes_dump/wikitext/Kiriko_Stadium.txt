| ability_details = * Explosive Kunais have the same projectile speed as regular kunais.
* The description is not accurate: The first 3 kunais of the magazine are replaced by explosive kunais. That means that refilling items and powers can replenish explosive kunais without having to reload whenever the current ammo count increases above this threshold.

{{PatchTableElement|2025-09-16|
{{DevComment|Developer comments: We’ve trimmed the numbers so talismans aren’t quite so magical, and donuts aren’t quite so nutritious. Sometimes too many sprinkles really are a bad thing.}}

{{al|Donut Delivery}} - Epic Ability Hero Item
* Cooldown Reduction decreased to 5% (Down from 10%).
* Healing decreased to 80 (Down from 120).

{{al|Talisman of Life}} - Epic Survival Hero Item
* Ability Power decreased to 15% (Down from 20%).
* Overhealth decreased to 80 (Down from 100).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-07-22|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Kiriko’s clone is reworked to serve a more utility-focused role, rather than functioning as the overly lethal auto-turret it once was. This change should help her contribute more reliably to team utility and generate Stadium Cash more consistently. In addition, Fleet Foot has been updated based on popular feedback, requiring a bit more commitment when diving into the backline, reinforcing the risk-reward dynamic of aggressive plays.}}

{{al|Clone Conjuration}} - Power
* Now the Clone's heal and damage contributes to earning Stadium Cash.
* Now there is a short delay before the Clone starts healing or dealing damage after being spawned.
* Clone's health has been reduced and can be increased by Ability Power.

{{al|Fleet Foot}} - Power
* Swift Step cooldown is increased by 30% when used without a target.

{{al|Foxy Fireworks}} - Power
* Projectile speed is now the same as regular kunai.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-07-08|
{{al|Clone Conjuration}} - Power
* Clone now deals 65% less healing and damage.
* Increased duration to 4s (Up from 2.5s.)
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-06-27|
{{DevComment|We have identified that Kiriko's clone is causing significant gameplay disruption and can be a source of frustration for players. While more comprehensive adjustments are planned for a future update, we are implementing an interim solution to mitigate its immediate impact in the current meta game.}}

{{al|Clone Conjuration}}
* Decreased duration to 2.5s (Down from 5s).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-06-24|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Soothing Step was designed to be a core part of Kiriko’s ability power-focused build, enabling her to serve as a highly mobile healer. This update brings it more in line with other build options while reinforcing her role as a capable burst healer in fast-paced fights. Additionally, Self-Care has been redesigned—both to address a bug and to make its healing more accurately reflect Kiriko’s healing output.}}

{{al|Donut Delivery|text=Soothing Step}} - Power
* Increased Healing to 120 (Up from 80).
* Replaced stat: From 10% Ability power to 10% Cooldown reduction.

{{al|Triple Threat}} - Power
* Spread reduced by 50%.

{{al|Self-Care}}
* Redesigned to: When you use Healing Ofuda, each Ofuda thrown heals you for 3% of max life.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-29|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Self-Care was falling short in terms of sustain, especially in longer engagements. This buff gives it a more meaningful impact, allowing players to recover more effectively and stay in the fight longer without relying solely on external healing.}}

{{al|Self-Care}} - Power
* Increased heal to 15% (Up from 5%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-01|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Kiriko was consistently earning a bit too much Cash from damage and healing.}}

* Reduced the amount of Stadium Cash gained from damage and healing by 16.67%.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-04-22|
; Introducing Stadium
