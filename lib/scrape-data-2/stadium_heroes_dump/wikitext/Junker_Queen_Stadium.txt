== Balance Change Log ==
{{PatchTableStart}}<onlyinclude>
{{PatchTableElement|2025-09-04|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Royal Bullets was winning duels a little too royally, popping targets with minimal setup. This trim keeps it snappy and satisfying without letting it wear the crown in every build.}}

{{al|Royal Bullets}} - Power
* Damage decreased to 40 (Down from 50).
}}

{{PatchTableElement|2025-08-26|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Time to sharpen the blade. Junker Queen‚Äôs axe has been stealing the spotlight for a while now, but we want her knife and blade build to cut in on the action too. With more enemies taking to the skies this season, this buff gives her the edge she needs to bring them crashing back down.}}

{{al|Merciless Magnetism}} - Power
* Increased distance to 25 meters (Up from 15 meters).

{{al|Twist The Knife}} - Power
* Increased duration to 2 seconds (Up from 1 seconds).

{{al|Blade Parade}} - Power
* Decreased charge time to 0.65 seconds (Down from 1 seconds).

{{al|Cut 'Em, Gracie!}} - Power
* Added: Hit enemies are slowed by 35% for 1 seconds.

{{al|Royal Bullets}} - Power
* Decreased duration to 2s. (Down from 3s).
* Removed distance condition.

{{al|Thrill of Battle}} - Power
* Increased heal to 100% (Up from 50%).

{{al|Bigger Magnet}} - Rare Ability Hero Item
* Now pulls downward if the enemy is airborne.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-06-24|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Shout and Chop has proven to be a highly effective combo for Junker Queen, often giving her a bit too much reliability in close-range engagements. This change is a first step toward dialing back that effectiveness, while still preserving the aggressive playstyle that makes her so satisfying to play.}}

{{al|Let's Go Win}} - Power
* Decreased cooldown reduction to 50% (down from 100%).

{{al|Cut 'Em, Gracie!}} - Power
* Increased reduction on cooldown to 2s per enemy hit (up from 1s).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-29|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Junker Queen‚Äôs axe has been doing most of the heavy lifting lately, leaving her shotgun and knife feeling a bit neglected. This update gives both of those tools some much-needed love to round out her kit and encourage more varied playstyles. We‚Äôre also adding a buff to Thick Skull to help her better withstand burst damage, giving her more staying power in fast-paced fights.}}

{{al|Royal Bullets}} - Power
* Increased range to 15 meters (Up from 12 meters).
* Increased damage to 50 (Up from 30).

{{al|Twist The Knife}} - Power
* Increased Wounds extension to 1 second (Up from 0.5 seconds).

{{al|Blade Parade}} - Power

{{al|Thick Skull}} ‚Äì Epic Survival Hero Item
* Increased Damage Reduction to 75% (Up from 50%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-08|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Junker Queen thrives when she can close the distance and brawl up close, and her current mobility has been allowing her to engage too freely. We're toning down her gap-closing potential to make her positioning more deliberate and reduce her ability to aggressively dive into enemy lines without consequence. This should encourage more thoughtful engagements while preserving her core bruiser identity.}}

{{al|Booming Voice}} ‚Äì Epic Ability Item
* Reduced Ability Power to 15% (down from 25%).

{{al|Slicing Spree}} ‚Äì Rare Hero Survival Item
* Reduced Move Speed stat to 5% (down from 10%).
* Reduced Move Speed while near an enemy with a Wound to 5% (down from 10%).
* Increased Attack Speed while near an enemy with a Wound to 10% (up from 5%).
