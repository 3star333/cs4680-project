{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Zarya continues to overperform at all levels. Most of her power comes from how Weapon Power scales with Energy, allowing her to reach very high damage ceilings, so slowing down the rate at which she can scale her Weapon Power.}}

* Reduced cash income from damage and healing by 12.5%.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-08|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Zarya continues to be overperforming, especially at higher levels of play. We're reducing some of the survivability of Weapon Power Zarya builds so that she should be more vulnerable, especially if she is opting to itemize full damage.}}

{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Lifelift has proven to be the most consistently effective Power for Zarya. We're reducing the scaling on it to try and make it feel less like a must pick in all styles of Zarya builds.

We‚Äôre also adding a little bit more healing in hopes of making Here to Spot You a bit more reliable of a power to choose from.}}
