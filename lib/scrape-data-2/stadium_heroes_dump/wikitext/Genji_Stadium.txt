{{PatchTableStart}}<onlyinclude>
{{PatchTableElement|2025-06-24|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Melee Genji builds have become very prominent, which is awesome! However, the bursty backstab build is a bit too consistent and can feel hard to interact with. We're reducing the damage ceiling for this build but upping it's sustain to compensate. We're also adding a little bit more power to the Ability Power Swift strike build to make its key pieces feel a bit more impactful early on in a match. We'll be looking at making a larger set of changes to Genji in a future update.}}
