{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Live data shows that Ana currently earns the lowest average currency at late game. While her overall performance has improved, we want to ensure she has enough resources to make meaningful and strategic choices in the armory. This update should help boost her economy and open up more build paths.}}

* Increased income from damage and healing by 11%.

{{al|Unscoped Resources}} - Epic Weapon Hero Item
* Added +15% Weapon Power.
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-07-08|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Ana remains one of the most impactful heroes when it comes to empowering her teammates, and this patch leans further into that strength. We're enhancing her ability to turn the tide of battle with key utility, particularly by increasing the impact of Biotic Grenade to create more high-stakes, high-reward moments in critical team fights. These changes aim to make Ana an even more decisive force in coordinated play.}}

* Decreased cooldown to 30% (Down from 35%).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-29|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: We’re aiming to make Ana feel more agile and resilient in mid-range engagements, where she often finds herself most vulnerable. By improving her survivability, these changes should help her better reposition under pressure and stay active in fights without compromising her high-impact support role. Tactical Rifle is a well-loved power, but we've received consistent feedback that its targeting could feel more like a hindrance than a help. In high-pressure moments, the auto-aim was too frequently locking onto allies instead of enemies, disrupting damage output. We're refining its behavior to better prioritize threats and ensure it feels like a reliable tool in combat.}}

{{al|Tactical Rifle (old)}} - Power
* Reduced aim tracking angle by 50%.

{{al|Dash Boots}} – Rare Ability Hero Item
* Increased Movement Speed bonus to 10% (Up from 5%).
* Decreased cooldown to 3 seconds (Down from 4 seconds).

* Biotic Grenade cooldown is reduced by 2 seconds for each target it hits (up from 1 second).
}}
{{PatchTableElement|2025-05-15|
{{DevComment|Developer Comments: Ana’s abilities feature some of the longest cooldowns in the support roster, and their impact hasn’t always matched that investment in Stadium. This update improves the effectiveness of her utility, helping her keep allies in the fight longer and better rewarding well-timed ability usage. These changes should give Ana more consistent value in extended engagements.}}
