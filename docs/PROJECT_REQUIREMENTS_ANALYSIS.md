# CS4680 Project Requirements Analysis

## ‚úÖ Requirements Met

### 1. Problem Identification and Relevance (10%) ‚úÖ
**Status:** FULLY MET

**Problem Identified:** 
Overwatch 2 Stadium game mode players struggle to optimize team compositions and item builds within budget constraints. The game has:
- 28 heroes
- 342 unique powers
- 915+ items with varying costs
- Complex team synergies and counter-play dynamics

**Market Need:** 
Players need strategic guidance to make informed decisions about:
- Hero selection for 5v5 compositions
- Power and item builds within credit budgets
- Counter-strategies against enemy compositions
- Optimal resource allocation

---

### 2. Application Design and Implementation (30%) ‚úÖ
**Status:** FULLY MET

**Implemented Features:**
- ‚úÖ Full-stack web application (Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- ‚úÖ Team composition builder (5v5 with visual interface)
- ‚úÖ Hero customization system (4 powers max, 6 items max)
- ‚úÖ Real-time budget tracking with cost calculations
- ‚úÖ OpenAI GPT-4o-mini API integration
- ‚úÖ Two AI-powered features:
  - Strategy Plan Generator
  - Build Suggestion System (budget-aware)
- ‚úÖ Context input for personalized AI responses
- ‚úÖ Search functionality for powers and items
- ‚úÖ Responsive design with dark gunmetal theme

**Technical Implementation:**
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Type-safe code with TypeScript
- Proper error handling and validation (Zod schemas)
- Environment variable management for API security
- Comprehensive documentation (README, ENVIRONMENT_SETUP)

---

### 3. Use of Prompt Engineering Techniques (20%) ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
**Status:** PARTIALLY MET - Needs explicit documentation

**Currently Implemented:**

1. **Persona Pattern** ‚úÖ
   - System prompts define AI as "expert Overwatch 2 Stadium gamemode strategist"
   - Establishes domain expertise and tone
   - Location: `/api/plan/route.ts` and `/api/suggest-build/route.ts`

2. **Structured Output Pattern** ‚úÖ
   - Prompts specify exact output format with sections
   - Uses ALL CAPS headers for scanning
   - Bullet-point formatting requirements
   - Example:
     ```
     KEY STRENGTHS:
     - List 2-3 main team strengths
     
     KEY WEAKNESSES:
     - List 2-3 vulnerabilities
     ```

3. **Context Inclusion Pattern** ‚úÖ
   - User can add custom context notes
   - AI incorporates context into strategy
   - Example: "Cassidy has good aim", "Our healers are not healing well"

4. **Few-Shot Learning** ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Consider adding example outputs in prompts
   - Would improve consistency

**RECOMMENDATION:** Create a dedicated documentation file explaining:
- Which prompt patterns are used and where
- How each pattern improves AI performance
- Examples of before/after results

---

### 4. UI/UX Design (10%) ‚úÖ
**Status:** FULLY MET

**UI Features:**
- ‚úÖ Professional dark gunmetal theme
- ‚úÖ Intuitive drag-and-drop style interface
- ‚úÖ Clear visual hierarchy
- ‚úÖ Responsive layout (left editor, right AI panel)
- ‚úÖ Real-time feedback (budget warnings, cost displays)
- ‚úÖ Search functionality for 900+ items
- ‚úÖ Loading states and error handling
- ‚úÖ Accessibility features (tooltips, clear labels)

**User Flow:**
1. Add heroes to ally/enemy teams
2. Mark yourself for budget tracking
3. Edit hero builds (powers + items)
4. Add context notes (optional)
5. Generate AI strategy or build suggestions
6. View formatted AI output in dedicated panel

**Design Consistency:**
- Color-coded teams (amber for allies, blue for enemies)
- Consistent button styles and interactions
- Professional gradient backgrounds
- Clear CTAs (Call-to-Actions)

---

### 5. Presentation and Live Demo (30%) üîÑ PENDING
**Status:** TO BE COMPLETED

**What You Have:**
- ‚úÖ Fully functional application
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository with complete code
- ‚úÖ README with setup instructions
- ‚úÖ Environment setup documentation
- ‚úÖ Security best practices implemented

**What You Need:**
- ‚è≥ Google Slides presentation (2-min format)
- ‚è≥ Demo video (3-5 minutes)
- ‚è≥ Live demo preparation
