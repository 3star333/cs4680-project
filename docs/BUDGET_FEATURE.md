# Budget & Build Suggestion Feature

## Overview
Added a personal budget tracking system that allows you to mark one ally as "yourself" and get AI-powered build suggestions based on your credit budget.

## Features

### 1. Mark as Yourself
- Any ally hero can be marked as "yourself" using the **"Mark as You"** button
- Only one ally can be marked at a time
- Marked hero displays a **"YOU"** badge in yellow
- This enables budget tracking and AI suggestions specifically for your hero

### 2. Budget Tracking
**Visual Budget Display:**
- Shows when any ally is marked as "yourself"
- Real-time tracking of:
  - **Total Budget**: Your available credits (default: 10,000)
  - **Spent**: Total cost of currently selected items
  - **Remaining**: Budget left for more items

**Budget Management:**
- Click "Change Budget" to adjust your total credits
- Budget input accepts any positive number
- Real-time updates as you add/remove items
- Warning indicator if you go over budget

### 3. Cost Display
- Each ally hero shows their total item cost: ðŸ’° X,XXX
- Helps compare build investments across team
- Only shows for heroes with items selected

### 4. AI Build Suggestions
**"Suggest Build (Budget)" Button:**
- Only appears when you've marked yourself
- Analyzes your current build and budget
- Considers team composition (allies & enemies)
- Provides specific recommendations

**AI Analysis Includes:**
1. Current build efficiency assessment
2. Specific item recommendations within remaining budget
3. Priority items that synergize with your hero
4. Alternative budget allocations
5. Strategy tips based on team comp

## Implementation Details

### Type System Updates
**`/types/editor.ts`:**
```typescript
export interface Item {
  cost?: number  // NEW: Item cost in credits
}

export interface HeroBuild {
  isYourself?: boolean  // NEW: Flag for "yourself"
}

export interface BudgetInfo {
  totalBudget: number
  currentSpent: number
  remaining: number
}
```

### State Management
**`/app/editor/page.tsx`:**
```typescript
// Budget state
const [creditBudget, setCreditBudget] = useState<number>(10000)
const [showBudgetInput, setShowBudgetInput] = useState(false)
const [isSuggestingBuild, setIsSuggestingBuild] = useState(false)

// Derived state
const yourBuildIndex = useMemo(() => 
  allies.findIndex(ally => ally.isYourself)
, [allies])

const budgetInfo = useMemo(() => {
  if (yourBuildIndex === -1) return { totalBudget: creditBudget, currentSpent: 0, remaining: creditBudget }
  const currentSpent = calculateBuildCost(allies[yourBuildIndex])
  return { totalBudget: creditBudget, currentSpent, remaining: creditBudget - currentSpent }
}, [allies, yourBuildIndex, creditBudget])
```

## Cost Data
- Item costs loaded from `/data/stadium/items.json`
- Each item has `cost` field (in credits)
- Cost range: 1000 - 4000+ credits
- Costs added to Item type during data loading

## Integration Points

### With Existing Features
1. **Hero Selection**: Works with existing hero search
2. **Item Selection**: Cost displayed during item picking
3. **Power Selection**: Powers don't have costs (focus on items)
4. **Strategy Plan**: Independent feature (can use both)

### With Stadium Data
- Reads item costs from `items.json`
- Preserves all existing item data
- No changes to powers or heroes data

## Technical Notes

### Performance
- Budget calculations use `useMemo` for efficiency
- Only recalculates when allies or budget changes
- Cost totaling is O(n) where n = number of items

### State Management
- Budget state stored at editor page level
- "Yourself" flag stored in HeroBuild objects
- Only one hero can be marked at a time

### Error Handling
- Validates hero selection before suggesting
- API errors caught and displayed to user
- Budget input sanitized (no negative values)

### Accessibility
- Budget input supports keyboard navigation
- Buttons disabled when invalid state
- Clear visual feedback for all actions

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions
1. **Preset Budgets**: Quick-select common budgets (5k, 10k, 20k)
2. **Budget History**: Track spending over time
3. **Item Comparison**: Side-by-side cost/benefit analysis
4. **Budget Templates**: Save and load budget strategies
5. **Cost Optimization**: AI auto-adjusts to hit exact budget
6. **Multi-Build Compare**: Compare costs across different builds
7. **Budget Sharing**: Share budget builds with friends
8. **Cost Alerts**: Warn before buying expensive items

### API Improvements
1. **Caching**: Cache suggestions for same hero/budget
2. **Streaming**: Stream AI response for faster feedback
3. **Refinement**: Allow follow-up questions on suggestions
4. **Learning**: Learn from user selections over time
